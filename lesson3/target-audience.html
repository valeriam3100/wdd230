        <h4>Franz Weber</h4>
    <div class="persona1">
    <img src="images/man.jpg"  class="image01" alt="man Franz">
    <p> Franz is 38 years old, married and has 2 children. He doesn't spend a lot of time with his family, since he works in the afternoon and on Saturdays and is very tired. He likes to play video games, he really likes hamburgers.<br>
        He works in a plastic factory, but is planning to set up a restaurant with his wife, since they recently arrived from Germany and want to sell typical German food. So since they are German they don't know what documents they need to legally open a restaurant, they would also like to know how is the best way for the Portuguese to buy their food.<br> 
        Franz uses the tablet a lot to search for information, since he thinks it is the right size and can use it anywhere, plus he has a vision problem.</p>

        <ul>

     <h4> Maria Ferreira </h4>
    <div class="persona2">
        <img src="images/woman.jpg" class="image02" alt="woman Ferreira">
        <p> Maria is 30 years old, lives alone with a cat. She likes to go for a walk, she doesn't like to be cold, and she is very friendly.<br>
            She has a shop that sells scented, handmade candles. She started her business 5 years ago and has done very well, enough to be self-sufficient. She, however, wants to increase her earnings, so she wants to go to fairs to sell the candles, but she doesn't know how to sign up or what she needs to go to sell the candles.<br> 
            Maria is very diligent with her work, she has a business plan, marketing and she does all this through the computer, however she also uses her cell phone more to communicate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenariopersona2">
            <ul>
    <li><h5> Scenario 1</h5>  
     <p> Maria is in the store and is searching the computer for the next fairs in Ovar.<br> 
        But she doesn't find enough information, and she doesn't like it.</p></li>     
    <li><h5> Scenario 2</h5>
    <p> Maria is walking and sees a poster for an upcoming fair, she doesn't see a cell phone number so she goes to search on google.</p></li>
